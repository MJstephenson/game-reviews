## Code Validation

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Use the space to discuss code validation for any of your own code files (where applicable).
You are not required to validate external libraries/frameworks, such as imported Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide a screenshot for each file you validate.

**PRO TIP**: Always validate the live site pages, not your local code. There could be subtle/hidden differences.

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

- If you are copying/pasting your HTML code, use this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
- (*recommended*) If you are using the live deployed site pages, use this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri

It's recommended to validate the live pages (each of them) using the deployed URL.
This will give you a custom URL as well, which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to a page to validate it again in the future.
The URL will look something like this:

- https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2FMJstephenson.github.io%2Fgame-reviews%2Findex.html

Sample HTML code validation documentation (tables are extremely helpful!):

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2FMJstephenson.github.io%2Fgame-reviews%2Findex.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-home.png) | Section lacks header h2-h6 warning |

| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining HTML files |

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

**IMPORTANT**: Python/Jinja syntax in HTML

Python projects that use Jinja syntax, such as `{% for loops %}`, `{% url 'home' %}`, and `{{ variable|filter }}`
will not validate properly if you're copying/pasting into the HTML validator.

In order to properly validate these types of files, it's recommended to
[validate by uri](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) from the deployed Heroku pages.

Unfortunately, pages that require a user to be logged-in and authenticated (CRUD functionality),
will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have
access to login to your pages.
In order to properly validate HTML pages with Jinja syntax for authenticated pages, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select **View Page Source** (usually `CTRL+U` or `⌘+U` on Mac).
- This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
- Copy everything, and use the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method.
- Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

- If you are copying/pasting your HTML code, use this link: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input
- (*recommended*) If you are using the live deployed site, use this link: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri

It's recommended to validate the live site if you only have a single CSS file using the deployed URL.
This will give you a custom URL as well, which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to the page to validate it again in the future.
The URL will look something like this:

- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2FMJstephenson.github.io%2Fgame-reviews

If you have multiple CSS files, then individual [validation by input](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
is recommended for the additional CSS files.


| File | Jigsaw URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| style.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2FMJstephenson.github.io%2Fgame-reviews) | ![screenshot](documentation/css-validation-style.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| checkout.css | n/a | ![screenshot](documentation/css-validation-checkout.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining CSS files |

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

| File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| script.js | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/validation/jshint.png) | One unused variable from external file |


### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

## Browser Compatibility

I have tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues. As a developer I am using Linux Ubuntu so I am not able to test Microsoft Edge or Safari browsers on my machine.

| Browser | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/screenshots/browser-compatability/chrome-test.png) | Works as expected |
| Firefox | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/screenshots/browser-compatability/firefox-test.png) | Works as expected |
| Brave | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/screenshots/browser-compatability/brave-test.png) | Works as expected |
| Opera | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/screenshots/browser-compatability/opera-test.png) | Works as expected |


## Responsiveness

I have tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues. I have tested all pages and they work as expected. Below are screenshots of the homepage on various devices.

| Device | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile (DevTools) | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/screenshots/responsiveness/mobile-test.png) | Works as expected |

## Lighthouse Audit

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Page | Size | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | Mobile | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-home-mobile.png) | Some minor warnings |
| Home | Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-home-desktop.png) | Few warnings |
| About | Mobile | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-about-mobile.png) | Some minor warnings |

## Defensive Programming

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

Flask:
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication


You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

## User Story Testing

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

## Bugs

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

It's very important to document any bugs you've discovered while developing the project.
Make sure to include any necessary steps you've implemented to fix the bug(s) as well.

For JavaScript and Python applications, it's best to screenshot the errors to include them as well.

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

## Unfixed Bugs

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
